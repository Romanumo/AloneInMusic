You might wanna focus on level game design and presentation now. Cause code is pretty oop as it is

Code refactor: 
* Abstract Weapon further
* Separate attack from beavior of weapon and integrate into a bullet instead	
* Make another sublclass for Weaponreloadable and make it SingleTimeBehavior instead of general weapon
* Exclude any unnecessary varibales
